# Data Science Practice Project

## Description
This repository contains exercises and practice projects in **Data Science**. It includes examples of data handling, exploratory analysis, visualization, and API connections.

> Personal reflection: I'm not sure if putting this on GitHub looks "professional", but I decided to do it to document my learning and practice good development and version control habits.

## Project Structure
- `backend/` - Django code for example APIs.
- `frontend/` - Scripts and tests for consuming APIs (React Native / Node.js).
- `data/` - Datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks with data exploration and experiments.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Technologies
- Python, Django
- React Native, Node.js
- Axios for API consumption
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git and GitHub for version control

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .\.venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3. Start Django server:
```
python manage.py runserver

```
4. Run frontend / API tests:
```
cd frontend
